# ITDEV162Project2
The primary goal of this project was to just assist me in becoming more familiar with the process of developing an API with a few endpoints that can add, delete, edit, or view things from a database. 
Similar to project one, this focuses on building objects with a limited number of fields and storing them in a database.
